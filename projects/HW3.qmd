# Package Set Up
```{r set up, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
message = FALSE # hide messages
warning = FALSE # hide warning


library(tidyverse) # Load packages
library(here)
library(gt) # chose gt

library(janitor) # Optional packages
library(readxl)
library(readr)
```



# Problem 1 

## a. Data Summarizing

I could compare the average time it took to get out of bed comparing alarm used
versus not used. I would want to know if getting out of bed after a natural 
wake up could be different on average than from an alarm, as there are different
factors like morning obligations hence an alarm versus less grogginess from 
waking up naturally. This comparison could be done by finding the mean of days
with alarm use and the mean of no alarm use, and it could inform me more about
the impact of alarms on my morning routine. 

## b. Visualization

```{r visualization , message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
message = FALSE # hide messages
warning = FALSE # hide warning

sleep_log <- read_csv("../ENVS-193DS_homework-03/data/sleep_log.csv") #read in data


ggplot(sleep_log, aes(x = `Alarm used?`, # set x and y
                      y = `Time it took to get out of bed (min)`)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0, aes(color = `Alarm used?`)) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", 
               shape = 18, size = 4, color = "black") + # add in mean
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se, geom = "errorbar", 
               width = 0.2, color = "black") + #add in error bars
  labs(
    title = "Minutes to Get Out of Bed with vs without Alarm", 
    x = "Alarm Used?",
    y = "Minutes to Get Out of Bed"
    # change title + x and y titles
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Yes" = "deeppink", "No" = "purple")) +
  theme_minimal()
# change theme to minimal and add color to values

```

## c. Caption

Figure 1, above, titled "Minutes to Get Out of Bed", with two jitterplots,
purple circular points representing days where alarms were not used and pink 
circular points representing days when an alarm was used. The y axis represents
how long it took to get out of bed, and the mean for each group is represented
by a black diamond with error bars represented by black bars. 


## d. Table Presentation

```{r tablegt}
summary_table <- sleep_log |> # assign to sleep log
  group_by(`Alarm used?`) |>  # set categories
  summarise(
    `Average time to get out of bed (min)` = 
      round(mean(`Time it took to get out of bed (min)`, na.rm = TRUE), 1), 
    # round data to one decimal point
    sample = n() # add in sample size
  )
# Display with gt
summary_table |> 
  gt() |>  #use gt
  tab_header(
    title = "Average Time to Get Out of Bed", # set title
    subtitle = "Grouped by Alarm Use" #set subtitle
  )
```


# Problem 2 Affective Visualization

## a. Description

An affective visualization for my data could go a variety of ways. I think it 
probably be focused around two very contrasting styles, maybe a jagged blue
landscape with a darkened ghoul of some sort to represent days which require an 
alarm wakeup. This could be contrasted by a smooth, warm hued style with a
peaceful visually appealing creature in order to represent a natural wakeup. 
This would evoke an emotional response to my topic that data obviously couldn't 
convey. I want to do this and highlight the fact that besides my alarm wakeup,
the data looks exactly the same, but the emotion behind it is very different.


## b. Sketch

# Title: Similar Data, Different Story


## c. Draft of Visualization

```{r insert image 2}
knitr::include_graphics("../ENVS-193DS_homework-03/code/IMG_0020.jpg") # insert image
```


## d. Artist Statement



This piece shows the hidden emotion behind what appears to be very similar data, 
via a gradient with a ghoulish creature on one side with sharp, jagged, tortured 
surroundings to represent waking up with an alarm and a calm peaceful gnome with 
smooth features and background to represent waking up naturally, with similar 
wake up times and times to get out of bed I used some  reference photos for the 
creatures from online but there wasn't really any outside influence or style. 
The closest would be some form of dark fantasy style? The form of the work is 
on a drawing app using an apple pen. I create this by making the gradient 
background and then drawing on it using the app. 


# Problem 3


## a. Revise and Summarize

The authors used panel data regression estimated using Ordinary Least Squares 
(OLS). Response variable is renewable electricity production and the predictor 
is Islam financing and Sukuk. 

```{r insert image 3}
knitr::include_graphics("../ENVS-193DS_homework-03/code/islam_table.png") #add in islam image
```

## b. Visual Clarity

The table clearly represents the data underlying the statistical tests, and 
each column labeled and values are super precise. It includes coefficients, 
standard errors, t-statistics, p-values, and significance levels, which help to
interpret the reliability of the work. The formatting is clean and makes it easy
to compare variables.

## c. Aesthetic Clarity

The aesthetic is and clean and doesn't have too many grid lines, while important 
p values are highlighted nicely using asterisks, and the data is nicely spaced. 
The precise nature of the data can be a little overwhelming with all of the 
decimals, but it is still manageable.

## d. Suggestions

Confidence intervals might help the data, and potentially coloring or bolding 
really important values could assist them further in getting their point across.
For more readability, a key with definitions for all of the words could be of 
worth as well.
