Completed in Spring quarter 2025, the culminating class for Environmental Studies 193PE (Introduction to Political Ecology), was to investigate and present a ~20 minute research question in relation to any given environmental topic. Along with this, subsequent application of Political Ecology concepts to the topic were required, drawing on Paul Robbin's "Political Ecology: A Critical Introduction (2019)" found [here](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Political_Ecology/wAe1DwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0).
