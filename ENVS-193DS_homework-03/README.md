# ENVS-193DS_homework-03
This is for my ENVS 193 DS HW 3 which focuses on personal data visualization, including exploratory, communicative, and affective visualizations, as well as some personal data collection updates, and analysis of figures from other research. 

data/sleep_log.csv:  Personal log of time it took to get out of bed, with or without an alarm. Used for creating summary plots.
code/codehw3.qmd: Main Quarto document containing analysis, reflections, and rendered output.
code/sketch1.png, IMG_0020.jpg, code/islam_table.png: In order, a hand-drawn image representing an affective visualization of the sleep log data, an expansion of the hand drawn image, and screenshot of a table from an academic article used for critique in Problem 3.

The final rendered output (codehw3.html) is available in the code/ folder. It includes 3 problems focusing on personal data, sketches relating to the data, and analyzing a paper.
