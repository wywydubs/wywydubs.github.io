## Where am I?

After spending the first 18 years of my life in Marin County California with my parents, sister, and 3 cats, I enrolled at UCSB for the 2023-24 school year and am now a rising junior. When I'm not in Santa Barbara, you can find me in Upstate New York, where I work at a sleepaway summer camp, usually in charge of the 5-9 year old section.

## What do I like?

A lot of things! Making charcuterie boards, being out in nature (Upstate New York has a lot of that), going to the gym, tossing a frisbee around, and generally anything that involves moving my body. I also work at Snag, the local scooter delivery service around UCSB, so catch me on a lime scooter too!

## What am I looking forward to?

I'm excited to continue my upper division learning within Environmental Studies, and progress further in my Economics path. I'm hoping to find an internship next school year that intersects those two. I also can't wait to play for our local club ultimate frisbee team this summer and fall, [Offshore Ultimate!](https://www.instagram.com/OffshoreUlti/)!
